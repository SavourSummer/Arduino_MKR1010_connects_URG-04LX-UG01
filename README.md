# Arduino_MKR1010_connects_URG-04LX-UG01
## Description
Arduino MKR1010 as USB host connects URG-04LX-UG01 with OTG cable

this repository is base on https://github.com/gdsports/USB_Host_Library_SAMD . what I do is add a line in Usb.cpp ,because 
Arduino MKR was missing packet when Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 was sending.

## About example
urgacm can receive complete packet form URG-04LX-UG01,but it sends a charater form buf every time until the number of packet equal 64.
urgacmAP1 sends whole buf to PC.


Pay attention toï¼Œit is a client in urgacm but server in urgacmAP and urgacmAP1.
## How to use
### First
   The +5V pin of Arduino MKR 1010 should connect +5 sourse , and the GND pin connect GND. Just do this and you should premise the voltage of +5V pin is 5V at least when MKR is connecting URG-04LX-UG01,otherwise it can't connect WiFi or receive data of URG.
### Second
   Upload example to MKR.If MKR is USBhost,you should click Reset button twice then the yellow LED of MKR flashes . In this time ,you can upload code when set correct port.
### Finally
   Set correct WiFi ssid and pass ,sure ,sever need port.
